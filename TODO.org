* Presentation Outline
  The goal of this presentation is that it should be "just enough" software to
  work with the AWS library.

  I would also like to show a couple more complex interactions than just using
  S3, to give a sense of working across different services. So here's a thought.

  1. Show how setting a client works with your current AWS setup, looking at
     =~/.aws/config= and =~/.aws/credentials=
     a. This could be an "admin" IAM cred
     b. Create a new S3 IAM user
  2. Show how it works when you explicitly set the credentials
     a. With the S3 IAM user just created
  3. Show how to see the ops for a client (Maybe this happens in step 1?)
  4. Show the docs for an op
     1. Show off REBL showing off the docs
  5. Create a bucket
  6. Add something to it from the repl
  7. Fetch a URL for that said something, and let people check it out
